Oops, it’s been more than a year since the last post. As always, work is
ongoing, but not quickly. Planned for the next release are better Linux
support and a more modern plugin format.

Perhaps a future post will discuss what problems I think the current
plugin format has, but in lieu of that, here’s a quick preview of what
the new set of tools would use:
