Another year, another anniversary

Today, we celebrate the anniversary of the release of the Ares source
code by reopening the AresCentral domain name---this time, as
AresCentral.org.

AresCentral.com was the original website for Ares: the folder *"Web Site
urls ƒ"* which comes with the game has two links to it (one for Netscape
and one for Internet Explorer), and now those same locations will lead
to here, the new home of Ares on the web. We're proud to be keeping the
tradition unbroken
